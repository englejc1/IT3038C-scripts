# Project 3

For Project 3, I have updated the Python Weather API script that I worked on for Lab 9 and added more information based on the zip code the user inputs, and also improved the formatting in the response.

NOTE: This script should be ran in Windows PowerShell 

In order to run this script, Python 3 and the requests module must be installed on your system.<br><br>
Open PowerShell as an administrator and run this command to verify that Python is installed.

```powershell
python --version
```
If Python 3 is not installed, install it from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ <br><br>
Navigate to the project3\code\ directory, then install the module "requests" if needed.

```powershell
cd *path to project directory*\project3\code\
pip install requests
```
Then run the script.

```powershell
python .\newweatherapi.py
```
You should then be able to follow the instructions in the console and receive weather information and the location of any zip code that you enter.
