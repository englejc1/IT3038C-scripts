# Project 2

For Project 2, I have updated the webserver that I worked on for Lab 6 and added a new page using NodeJS and HTML that links to the GitHub page of itslef that will allow anyone to veiw and download the code for the webserver.

NOTE: This script should be ran in Windows PowerShell 

In order to run this script, NodeJS must be installed on your system. Run this command to verify that it is.

```powershell
node --version
```
Navigate to the project2\code\ directory, then start the script.

```powershell
cd C:\it3038c-scripts\project2\code\
node .\newserver.js
```
You should get a returned message that states: "Server listening on port 3000"

Open Microsoft Edge, and enter into the address bar: "localhost:3000"

Click on the second link that says: "View and download source code for this site!"

Then click the link on this page, which will bring you to my GitHub page for this project.
